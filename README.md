## Mission

At the heart of MiauToken lies a groundbreaking mission: to utilize the innovative prowess of blockchain technology for aiding cat refugees across the globe. MiauToken is more than a cryptocurrency; it's a beacon of hope, fully operated in a decentralized manner, where every token holder plays a vital role in steering the project's direction. Through on-chain governance, our community decides which cat shelters to support, ensuring absolute transparency and accountability in every action we take. Our decentralized approach empowers the community, letting those who hold MiauTokens make impactful decisions directly affecting cat shelters in need.

## Tokenomics

MiauToken introduces a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, crafted to build a sustainable ecosystem. At inception, 200 million tokens are minted; half of these are sold for 10 ETH, while the remaining half is paired with the raised ETH to establish liquidity. This initial step ensures a fair and stable entry for future participants. Every transaction with MiauToken incurs a nominal fee of 0.1%, creating a continuous revenue stream. These collected fees serve a dual purpose: they provide financial aid to cat shelters and fund in-person community meetups, fostering engagement and incentivizing participation within the MiauToken ecosystem.

## On-chain DAO

MiauDAO stands as the project's governance pillar, where MiauToken holders wield the power to make decisions. From deciding which cat shelters receive support to approving financial allocations for community events, the control rests entirely in the hands of our token holders. Cat shelters seeking assistance can submit proposals directly to the MiauToken DAO on Tally, where token holders review and vote, ensuring only the most impactful initiatives receive funding. This process highlights our commitment to decentralization and transparency, allowing the community to dictate the course of our charitable journey.

## MiauSpotted Feature

Introducing "MiauSpotted" â€“ a special function within the MiauToken smart contract designed for those passionate about their feline companions. Available to anyone holding over 20,000 Miau tokens (valued at approximately $8), this feature empowers MiauToken holders to share cherished photos of their cats with the wider community. Once shared, these images are indexed by The Graph and proudly displayed on the MiauToken landing page. "MiauSpotted" is more than just a feature; it's a community-driven showcase that celebrates the love and joy cats bring into our lives, inviting token holders to connect and share in a uniquely engaging way.

## The Code Explained

Our smart contracts lay the foundation for the MiauToken and MiauDAO, meticulously designed to support our mission and operations:

- **Minting and Vesting:** We mint 200 million tokens at genesis, ensuring a controlled supply with a clear vesting schedule for the DAO's future endeavors.
- **Fee Collection:** A small fee from each transaction builds a treasury, dedicated to aiding cat shelters and organizing community meetups.
- **Governance:** MiauDAO's functions allow token holders to vote on proposals, embodying our decentralized ethos.
- **MiauSpotted:** A fun, interactive feature encouraging our community to share their beloved cat's photos, fostering a deeper connection among members.

Through these carefully crafted smart contracts, we aim to achieve a transparent, efficient, and secure ecosystem that aligns with our decentralized philosophy, enabling us to make a significant impact on the lives of cat refugees worldwide.
